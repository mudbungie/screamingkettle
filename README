monitor readme

This is a collection of little daemons that are to be initiated by a management
program, monitor.py. It will be run by the system scheduler, but could be 
easily modified to run independently. The management program will run every 
monitor in the monitors/ directory.

The management program will leave a timestamp in the status/ directory. The 
other daemons will also leave information in this directory, usually just a 
timestamp with a status, but in other cases, (notably failures), they will
leave notes.

All of the statuses are read by the bottle server readout.py, which will 
populate status icons, and any notes left by the monitors into a webpage, and
return that to browser requests. Status colors are as follows:
    green   okay
    yellow  outdated
    red     failed
