This is a script (watchPots.py), which runs one of several types of
essentially Boolean verfications of external services. This then records those
statuses, which are read by a Bottle server (whistle.py), and reported to a
web browser on port 8000.

The most important files to understand here are:
whistle.py: a Bottle server, to be run on the monitoring machine for easy web readout
watchPots.py: checks all the services, provides the statuses read by whistle
kettles.py: library for the previous two
steam.py: is an easy, portable Bottle server for giving output to a browser

To add new services for monitoring, add a file in the monitors/ directory, with
a recognizable name for the file. This filename is how the service will be
listed on the Bottle server. Other fields are to be listed on their own line,
separated from their values by an '='.

Supported services and their directives are as follows:
    http:
    serviceType=website
    url=http://example.com

    minecraft: (will list the number of connected players in the notes field)
    serviceType=minecraft
    connectionString=example.com:1234

    ping:
    serviceType=ping
    address=1.2.3.4 OR example.com

    portscan:
    serviceType=portscan
    address=1.2.3.4 OR example.com
    port=1000
