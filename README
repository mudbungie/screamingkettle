This is a service monitoring program. It performs checks managed by a sqlite database. 

To initialize the database, run $ python3 Database.py
To add services, run $ python3 skmgmnt.py
    follow the prompts.
There are some additional flags that aren't set by default by skmgmnt.
If you want those flags on, go ahead and set them manually via sqlite.

potwatcher.py is the daemon. Once per second, it runs checks for any services whose 
interval has elapsed. webinterface.py serves up a basic little table of statuses on
port 8000.

steam.py is a basic little webserver that can be run on ay server to send the output
of a command to a web interface, so that you can check values with potwatcher.
Usage is: ./steam.py [port] [command, probably with quotes]
Just point a service at the steam port on whatever server it is with skmgmnt, and 
you're good to go.

In order to run things at startup, add the following lines to rc.local (also, install tmux):
tmux new -s potwatcher -d 'cd /home/screamingkettle/screamingkettle/ ; source env/bin/activate ; ./potwatcher.py'
tmux new -s webinterface -d 'cd /home/screamingkettle/screamingkettle/ ; source env/bin/activate ; ./webinterface.py'
